\begin_layout Section
Next-roll probability vs.
 next-few-roll probability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Next-roll probability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is simple to calculate.
 If you are rolling five dice and need five of them to match, you have a
 simple problem that can be calculated with binomial probability.
 Binomial probability predicts yes/no (binary) results from a set of 
\emph on
independent
\emph default
 experiments.
 This is useful in predicting the next roll and would therefore be useful
 on the final dice roll because it does not predict the outcome of a later
 roll.
 To calculate the binomial probability, first you need to calculate the
 number of combinations from your provided numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $nCr$
\end_inset

 is the number of combinations in a given set
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is the number of dice you need to match the first number
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the number of dice you are rolling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
nCr=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You then take this result and plug it into a binomial probability formula
 using the same values for the variables.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the probability of an individual occurrence, so in this case it's 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{1}{6}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(x=r)=nCr\times p^{r}\times(1-p)^{n-r}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we wanted to calculate the chances for a Yahtzee then, you see that after
 one roll your chances are roughly 0.08%, or 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{8}{10,000}$
\end_inset

.
 Notice below that we use 4 instead of 5 because the first dice rolled doesn't
 matter.
 The probability of rolling all five dice to be a certain value (like all
 1's) is roughly 0.012%, but that multiplied by 6 gives us roughly 0.08%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(x)=\frac{4!}{(4-4)!4!}\times(\nicefrac{1}{6})^{4}\times(1-\nicefrac{1}{6})^{4-4}\approx0.08\%
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Next-few-roll probability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next-roll probability is simple.
 You plug the numbers into the formula and get your expected result.
 The task becomes infinitely more complicated when you have more rolls involved.
 A smart player might roll a Yahtzee over the course of three turns like
 this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
5 5 3 1 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
5 5 5 4 6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
5 5 5 5 5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their chances of getting a Yahtzee on the first attempt was 0.08% as we calculate
d above.
 But as they set aside other dice and got closer to a Yahtzee, their chances
 went up.
 How can you draw a conclusion on the 
\emph on
overall
\emph default
 probability of getting a Yahtzee over the course of all three rolls, rather
 than just one? What if the player was allowed five rolls? At how many rolls
 does your chance of obtaining a Yahtzee go above 50%?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These all require a 
\emph on
dependent
\emph default
 formula that takes into account the previous rolls and calculates a possible
 outcome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Markov chains and transition matrices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Markov chain describes the likelihood of moving from one state to the
 next solely based on the previous state.
 Markov chains are useful in many real-world situations like cruise control,
 typing prediction, and page ranking used at Google.
 The process is simple in theory, but a bit tricky when you have so many
 plugs and slots.
 We should be able to calculate our answer given the transition matrix below
 in a 5x5 grid (five being the amount of dice available to roll).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}? & ? & ? & ? & ?\\
? & ? & ? & ? & ?\\
? & ? & ? & ? & ?\\
? & ? & ? & ? & ?\\
? & ? & ? & ? & ?
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can fill in each question mark with a fraction that describes our likelihood
 of staying in that state or progressing to the next.
 It's important to start small, so we'll come back to this later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Probability with less dice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's tricky to calculate the probability of achieving different goals when
 you have five dice.
 So we'll start small and it should make the whole process much easier to
 understand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
One dice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is as simple as it gets.
 When you roll a single die your chances of getting any result are 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{1}{6}$
\end_inset

 because the die is six-sided.
 If we want a specific result, our chance then is 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{1}{6}$
\end_inset

 and our chance of 
\emph on
not getting that result
\emph default
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{5}{6}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}A & \nicefrac{1}{6}\\
B & \nicefrac{5}{6}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the last time we'll assume we want a specific result, like getting
 exactly a 6.
 That's a whole other ballgame.
 In a Yahtzee it doesn't matter what numbers are present on the dice as
 long as they match.
\end_layout

Two dice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is still very simple.
 In a given two-dice roll you have 
\begin_inset Formula $6\times6=36$
\end_inset

 possible outcomes.
 When you roll two dice one of two things will happen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Both dice match (AA)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Neither dice match (AB)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can calculate our chances of both dice matching to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{6}{36}$
\end_inset

.
 This makes sense because there are six ways you can score a pair from two
 dice: 
\begin_inset Formula $\{1,1\},\{2,2\},\{3,3\},\{4,4\},\{5,5\},\{6,6\}$
\end_inset

.
 So now we can fill in our dice probability chart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}A & A & \nicefrac{6}{36}\\
A & B & \nicefrac{30}{36}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remember, we can only get one of the two outcomes so they have to add up
 to 1.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{6}{36}+\nicefrac{30}{36}=1$
\end_inset

 so we know we're good.
\end_layout

Three dice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Getting a little more complicated but not by much.
 In a given three-dice roll you have 
\begin_inset Formula $6\times6\times6=216$
\end_inset

 possibilities.
 When you roll three dice one of the following will happen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
They all match (AAA)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Two of them match (AAB)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
None of them match (ABC)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are six ways all the dice can match: 
\begin_inset Formula $\{1,1,1\},\{2,2,2\},\{3,3,3\},\{4,4,4\},\{5,5,5\},\{6,6,6\}$
\end_inset

.
 In our probability chart we see the following values:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}A & A & A & \nicefrac{6}{216}\\
A & A & B & \nicefrac{90}{216}\\
A & B & C & \nicefrac{120}{216}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To calculate the second row we realize that there are six possibilities
 for A, five for B, and three places where B could be present.
 
\begin_inset Formula $6\times5\times3=\nicefrac{90}{216}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To calculate the final row we could take 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{216}{216}-\nicefrac{6}{216}-\nicefrac{90}{216}$
\end_inset

, but it's better to check our math.
 The chances of rolling the first die one particular number is 
\begin_inset Formula $6$
\end_inset

.
 The chances of rolling another die that is different from the first is
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{5}{6}$
\end_inset

.
 The chances of rolling a third dice different from both the first dice
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{4}{6}$
\end_inset

.
 This gives us 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{5}{6}\times\nicefrac{4}{6}=\nicefrac{120}{216}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Four dice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are 
\begin_inset Formula $6^{4}=1296$
\end_inset

 possibilities here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\noindent
They all match (AAAA) - 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{6}{1296}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Three match (AAAB) - 
\begin_inset Formula $6\times5\times4=\nicefrac{120}{1296}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Two pairs (AABB) - 
\begin_inset Formula $6\times5\times3=\nicefrac{90}{1296}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One pair with two others (AABC) - 
\begin_inset Formula $6\times5\times4\times3\times2=\nicefrac{720}{1296}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
None of them match (ABCD) - 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{6}{6}\times\nicefrac{5}{6}\times\nicefrac{4}{6}\times\nicefrac{3}{6}=\nicefrac{360}{1296}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our new concepts here are the two pairs and one pair with two others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two pairs is 
\begin_inset Formula $6\times5\times3$
\end_inset

 because this is the same probability as seen in the three dice stage except
 another dice is added.
 It's the same equation, but because we added a new dice it's 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{1}{6}$
\end_inset

 less, e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{90}{216}$
\end_inset

 vs.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{90}{1296}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One pair with two others is the most likely option here coming in at 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{720}{1296}$
\end_inset

 (55%).
 The calculation is 
\begin_inset Formula $6\times5\times4\times3\times2$
\end_inset

 because there is a probability of 5 for B in 3 positions and 4 for C in
 2 positions.
 So written in different terms, the calculation is 
\begin_inset Formula $(6\times1)\times(5\times3)\times(4\times2)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we can draw our probability chart for four dice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}A & A & A & A & \nicefrac{6}{1296}\\
A & A & A & B & \nicefrac{120}{1296}\\
A & A & B & B & \nicefrac{90}{1296}\\
A & A & B & C & \nicefrac{720}{1296}\\
A & B & C & D & \nicefrac{360}{1296}

 possibilities here.
 We'll use the official Yahtzee names here.
\end_layout

\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{6}{6}\times\nicefrac{5}{6}\times\nicefrac{4}{6}\times\nicefrac{3}{6}\times\nicefrac{2}{6}=\nicefrac{720}{7776}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below is our probability chart for all five dice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}A & A & A & A & A & \nicefrac{6}{7776}\\
A & A & A & A & B & \nicefrac{150}{7776}\\
A & A & A & B & B & \nicefrac{300}{7776}\\
A & A & A & B & C & \nicefrac{1200}{7776}\\
A & A & B & C & D & \nicefrac{3600}{7776}\\
A & A & B & B & C & \nicefrac{1800}{7776}\\
A & B & C & D & E & \nicefrac{720}{7776}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the probability here, we see that you are more than twice as
 likely to roll a small straight than a three-of-a-kind, and twenty-four
 times more likely to roll a small straight than a four-of-a-kind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both a three-of-a-kind and four-of-a-kind can score a maximum of 30 points
 (the value of a small straight).
 You have a 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{1}{7776}$
\end_inset

 chance of scoring 
\emph on
the same amount of points
\emph default
 in a three-of-a-kind or four-of-a-kind (excluding a Yahtzee), because the
 roll would have to consist of five 6's.
 That's 0.012%.
 Not great odds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Strategically, this means a player should always cancel out a four-of-a-kind
 and three-of-a-kind before a small straight if it comes down to it.
 It also means that you should wait until later in the game to attempt a
 small straight and potentially re-roll one that you might get from chance,
 because you are so likely to get one again (55.56%).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Creating our transition matrix
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we get to the exciting part.
 A transition matrix shows us the fractional chances of getting from one
 state to the next.
 This will go hand in hand with our Markov chain later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}? & ? & ? & ? & ?\\
? & ? & ? & ? & ?\\
? & ? & ? & ? & ?\\
? & ? & ? & ? & ?\\
? & ? & ? & ? & ?
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can fill in our unavailable spaces with 0's since a smart player would
 never re-roll dice they already had matching.
 That is, if you rolled five dice and three matched, you would always re-roll
 exactly two.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}? & ? & ? & ? & ?\\
0 & ? & ? & ? & ?\\
0 & 0 & ? & ? & ?\\
0 & 0 & 0 & ? & ?\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & ?
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also know that once you roll five matching dice you would always keep
 it.
 This means our final position 
\begin_inset Formula $(5,5)$
\end_inset

 has a 1 in it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}? & ? & ? & ? & ?\\
0 & ? & ? & ? & ?\\
0 & 0 & ? & ? & ?\\
0 & 0 & 0 & ? & ?\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can fill in the numbers in the column above the 1 because they represent
 our chances of moving from the state below to the state above.
 In this case, it's always 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{6}^{n}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the distance from 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}? & ? & ? & ? & \nicefrac{1}{1296}\\
0 & ? & ? & ? & \nicefrac{1}{216}\\
0 & 0 & ? & ? & \nicefrac{1}{36}\\
0 & 0 & 0 & ? & \nicefrac{1}{6}\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In English this means if we roll five dice our chances of getting all five
 matching is in the position 
\begin_inset Formula $(5,1)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{1}{1296}$
\end_inset

, which is 0.08%.
 You should start to become familiar with these numbers and as we've found
 in several other places, our chances of rolling a Yahtzee 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 0.08% so we know we're on the right track.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important note is that each row here must equal 1 because you have to
 have at least one of the outcomes occur.
 This makes it easy to figure out some of our next rows and double check
 our math.
 Let's fill in the fourth row.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}? & ? & ? & ? & \nicefrac{1}{1296}\\
0 & ? & ? & ? & \nicefrac{1}{216}\\
0 & 0 & ? & ? & \nicefrac{1}{36}\\
0 & 0 & 0 & \nicefrac{5}{6} & \nicefrac{1}{6}\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, our fourth row (which represents when a person is rolling one die)
 tells us we have a 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{1}{6}$
\end_inset

 chance of getting the number we need and a 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{5}{6}$
\end_inset

 chance of staying at that level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For our third row we have two dice we are re-rolling.
 We have a 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{5}{6}\times\nicefrac{5}{6}=\nicefrac{25}{36}$
\end_inset

 chance of not getting what we need.
 This means we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{10}{36}$
\end_inset

 chance of getting one matching dice but not the other (
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{1}{6}\times\nicefrac{5}{6}$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}? & ? & ? & ? & \nicefrac{1}{1296}\\
0 & ? & ? & ? & \nicefrac{1}{216}\\
0 & 0 & \nicefrac{25}{36} & \nicefrac{10}{36} & \nicefrac{1}{36}\\
0 & 0 & 0 & \nicefrac{5}{6} & \nicefrac{1}{6}\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our fourth row is the hardest to calculate.
 In our fourth row we are re-rolling three dice.
 We have a 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{1}{6}\times\nicefrac{1}{6}\times\nicefrac{5}{6}\times3=\nicefrac{15}{216}$
\end_inset

 chance of getting a pair from three.
 Now you might be catching on now and thinking that the chance of missing
 all three would be 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{5}{6}\times\nicefrac{5}{6}\times\nicefrac{5}{6}=\nicefrac{125}{216}$
\end_inset

.
 This is incorrect because a player might roll a pair on the first roll
 and then roll three matching dice (that don't match the pair) on their
 second roll.
 They would then keep the three and re-roll the pair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order for us to calculate this we simply need to subtract the chance
 of getting all three matching from that number.
 If we go back to our 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
hyperref[sec:three]{three dice}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 section we see a 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{6}{216}$
\end_inset

 chance of getting three matching.
 We also have to subtract one from that number because one of those matches
 would create a Yahtzee.
 This gives us 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{125}{216}-\nicefrac{5}{216}=\nicefrac{120}{216}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, we have the chance we get three matching and re-roll the other two.
 This would be 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{5}{6}\times\nicefrac{5}{6}\times\nicefrac{1}{6}\times3$
\end_inset

 This is simply the reverse of our above equation which got us 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{15}{216}$
\end_inset

 That leaves us 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{75}{216}$
\end_inset

, which we also add that magic 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{5}{216}$
\end_inset

 chance that we jumped ship and are re-rolling the pair instead of the three-of-
a-kind.
 Thankfully, adding up all four of these equals 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{216}{216}$
\end_inset

 If you did roll with nothing matching you would essentially have a large
 straight.

This is a slightly intensive process with such a big matrix.
 It's better to just leave it to a computer because a task like this could
 take quite a long time by hand.
 Here are our results:

\begin_layout Standard
You'll notice each row adds up to 100% exactly how our first transition

\begin_layout Section
What do our results tell us?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our most important number is in cell 
\begin_inset Formula $(1,5)$
\end_inset

.
 This tells us the chance of a smart player getting a Yahtzee over three
 turns is roughly 4.6%.
 Much higher than over one round (0.08%).
 Below are some more conclusions we can draw.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the player was allowed five rolls their chance of getting a Yahtzee would
 rise from 4.6% to 17%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
After 10 rolls your chance of obtaining a Yahtzee is higher than 50%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Your chance of getting a four-of-a-kind over three rolls is 24.5%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Your chance of getting a three-of-a-kind is 45.2%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You're more likely to get a three-of-a-kind (45.2%) than a pair (25.6%).
 This makes sense because you would have to be pretty unlucky to never get
 more than a pair from rolling three times.
